# webrtc
prebuilt iOs webrtc library containing both armv7 and arm64 binaries.

If you dont want spend an hour or two downloading gigas of webrtc source and another hour building them.
Just grab libWebRTC.a in this repo and put in your project. 

It has armv7 and arm64 built inside (i.e. good enough for an app to submit to appstore but will not run on emulators). Change valid architecture in your project setting to armv7, arm64 and you are good to go.
